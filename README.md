# Emergency-Notes
Emergency notes is a Web-based note sharing app developed by a Sacramento State based design team. This App was designed to aid students in their classes by facilitating peer-to-peer learning through sharing and commenting on the contents of a class or lecture of a specific teacher via the notes taken. As of today, Emergency Notes is still a work in progress and so this, below is a simple demonstration of the full stack software used in its construction.
